This document provides an overview of the unit tests conducted to ensure the reliability and security of the API project. The tests cover all core functionality and include basic security checks, such as authentication and role-based access control. The results indicate that all tests passed successfully, demonstrating robust endpoint implementation.

Test Coverage Summary
1. Application Endpoints
The following scenarios were tested under the ApplicationController:

Test Case	Description	Status
should allow a user to create a new application	Confirms that authenticated users can create an application with valid data.	✅ Passed
should allow a user to update their application	Validates that users can update the details of an existing application they own.	✅ Passed
should prevent a user from accessing restricted routes	Ensures users with insufficient roles cannot access admin-only routes.	✅ Passed
should allow an admin to access restricted routes	Verifies that users with the admin role can access protected routes for management purposes.	✅ Passed
should prevent a user from deleting an application	Confirms that users without the required role cannot delete an application.	✅ Passed
should return 401 for unauthenticated requests	Validates that unauthenticated requests to protected endpoints are blocked with a 401 response code.	✅ Passed

Testing Process
Setup:

The environment was configured with a mocked database and authentication tokens for admin and user roles.
Sample data was prepared for testing application creation, updates, and role-based access scenarios.
Authentication and Authorization:

Tokens were generated using a utility function for valid roles (user and admin).
Requests with missing or invalid tokens were tested to ensure proper error responses.
Functionality Validation:

Endpoints were tested for their primary functionality, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting applications.
Edge cases, such as restricted access and unauthenticated requests, were validated.
Execution:

Tests were executed using the Jest framework.
All scenarios passed successfully within an acceptable timeframe.
Key Observations
Authentication:

Unauthorized requests were correctly blocked with a 401 Unauthorized response.
Users with valid tokens were granted access to the appropriate endpoints.
Authorization:

Role-based restrictions were enforced effectively:
Users with insufficient roles received a 403 Forbidden response for restricted routes.
Admins were granted access to manage applications.
Data Integrity:

Application data was created and updated successfully with the expected responses.
Conclusion
All unit tests were executed successfully, ensuring the API's functionality and reliability. Both authentication and role-based authorization mechanisms are working as expected. The implementation is robust against unauthorized access and improper data manipulation.
