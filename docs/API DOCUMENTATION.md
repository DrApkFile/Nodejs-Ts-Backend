This project is an API for managing applications, designed with robust functionality and built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms. It provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting application records while ensuring secure access through role-based controls.

Features
CRUD Functionality:

Create, read, update, and delete applications.
Authentication:

JWT-based authentication to secure API endpoints.
Role-Based Authorization:

Restricts access to specific routes based on user roles (admin and user).
Validation:

Input validation to ensure data integrity.
Testing:

Comprehensive unit tests for functionality and reliability.
Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js
MySQL
Postman (for manual API testing)
Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configure environment variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory.
Add the following variables:
env
Copy code
DATABASE_URL=mysql://<user>:<password>@localhost:3306/<database>
JWT_SECRET=<your-secret-key>
PORT=3000
Set up the database:

Use Prisma to migrate the database schema:
bash
Copy code
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
Start the server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Endpoints
Base URL: /api/v1/application
Method	Endpoint	Description	Access
POST	/create	Create a new application	user
GET	/:id/get	Get an application by ID	admin
PUT	/:id/update	Update an existing application	user
DELETE	/:id/delete	Delete an application	admin
Testing
Unit Tests
This project uses Jest for testing. Unit tests cover the following:

Application functionality (create, update, retrieve, delete).
Authentication validation.
Role-based access control.
Running Tests
Execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm test
Example Test Results:

css
Copy code
 PASS  src/controllers/applicationController.test.ts (22.988 s)
  Application Endpoints
    âˆš should allow a user to create a new application (4390 ms)
    âˆš should allow a user to update their application (791 ms)
    âˆš should prevent a user from accessing restricted routes (18 ms)
    âˆš should allow an admin to access restricted routes (127 ms)
    âˆš should prevent a user from deleting an application (12 ms)
    âˆš should return 401 for unauthenticated requests (8 ms)

Postman Collection
Folder Structure
Create a Postman collection with the following folders:
Authentication:
Token generation requests.
Application Management:
Requests for create, get, update, and delete.
Steps to Test with Postman
Import the provided Postman collection file (postman_collection.json) into Postman.
Set the Authorization header for each request:
plaintext
Copy code
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Test each endpoint with valid and invalid data to ensure proper responses.
Security
Authentication
Implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Tokens are validated before granting access to protected endpoints.
Authorization
Role-based access control ensures the following:
user role: Access to create and update.
admin role: Access to get and delete.
Database Schema
The database is managed using Prisma ORM, with the following schema:

prisma
Copy code
model Application {
  id        Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name      String
  email     String
  position  String
}

Future Enhancements
Add more detailed logging for error tracing.
Implement rate-limiting to prevent abuse.
Extend test coverage for edge cases and integration testing.
